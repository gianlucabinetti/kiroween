# Grimoire Stack - Product Vision

## Overview

Grimoire Stack is a reusable SaaS skeleton for building internal tools, dashboards, and CRMs. It provides a solid foundation with authentication, database integration, and UI components that can be quickly adapted for new projects.

This is a Kiroween-themed hackathon project that demonstrates the power of spec-driven development, steering docs, and agent hooks through two example applications:

1. **Haunted Tasks** - A spooky team task dashboard for managing projects and todos
2. **Coven CRM** - A simple CRM for tracking clients, contacts, and interactions

## Target Users

- **Solo developers** building side projects and MVPs
- **Indie hackers** who need to ship fast without reinventing the wheel
- **Small teams** wanting consistency across internal tools
- **Developers learning** modern full-stack patterns with Kiro

## Value Proposition

- **Reusability** - Write once, use across multiple apps
- **Consistency** - Shared components, patterns, and conventions
- **Rapid prototyping** - Go from idea to working app in hours, not days
- **Learning resource** - See how specs, steering, and hooks work together
- **Halloween vibes** - Because building should be fun

## Non-Goals

- Not a full enterprise framework with every feature imaginable
- Not optimized for massive scale (though it could be extended)
- Not a replacement for established frameworks like Redwood or Blitz
- Not trying to be opinionated about every decision

## Success Criteria

A developer should be able to:

1. Clone the repo and run it locally in under 5 minutes
2. Understand the architecture by reading the steering docs
3. Create a new app from the skeleton in under 30 minutes
4. See clear examples of Kiro's spec-driven workflow
